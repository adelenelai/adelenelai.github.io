# About

Hello World :)

I like building software and analysing data to investigate, optimise, and solve problems relating to the environment and sustainability.

I'm currently a software developer at [WEO](https://www.weo-water.com/), a spacetech-environmental analytics company based in Luxembourg. At WEO, I build software pipelines to extract climate and sustainability insights from satellite imagery using cutting-edge deep learning and ML algorithms.

My background is in cheminformatics (chemical data science) and environmental chemistry. I completed my dual PhD on **cheminformatics approaches for identifying and managing environmental chemical pollutants** at the [Environmental Cheminformatics](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/environmental_cheminformatics/research_projects) Group (University of Luxembourg) and the [Cheminformatics and Computational Metabolomics](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/alumni/adelene-lai/) Group (Friedrich Schiller University, Germany). 

Prior to that, I was awarded the merit-based [ETH Master's Scholarship](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html) in 2015 to study [Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics](https://ibp.ethz.ch/). Before ETH, I studied Chemistry at Wellesley College, where I graduated *magna cum laude* with a [B.A. Chemistry](https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry) as a recipient of the merit-based Gulick Farnsworth scholarship.

I have contributed technical expertise to multiple international projects related to **sustainability, chemicals, and waste**, most recently to UN Environmentâ€™s [Global Chemicals Outlook II report](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-chemicals-outlook-ii-legacies-innovative-solutions) and [Assessment Report on Issues of Concern: Chemicals and Waste Issues Posing Risks to Human Health and the Environment](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33807/ARIC.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). I also led a [report on Solid Waste Management in Small Island Developing States](https://tdlab.usys.ethz.ch/teaching/tdcs/former/cs2016.html), following fieldwork in the Seychelles.

I was born and grew up in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. 

In my free time, I enjoy doing sprint triathlons, shopping at the morning wet market, and going to chamber and orchestral concerts.
