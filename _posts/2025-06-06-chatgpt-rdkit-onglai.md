# ChatGPT, make my PhD work obsolete
## Can AI do Chemistry?

I've been pondering this question for a while, ever since my days in research spent hanging out with great people at the Steinbeck Group i.e., the ones who brought you Decimer, Surge, STOUT, COCONUT, MORTAR, Ertl FG Finder and more recently, the Cheminf Microservice.

Coming from environmental chemistry, there were plenty of use cases and problems I wanted to solve. However, especially at the beginning of my PhD,I often lacked the skills to solve them.

A few years have passed; AI has gotten 'smarter' (at least the foundational models have), and interest in how much chemistry AI can do is more intense than ever. 

In fact, this question seems to be occupying the research community - see recent papers on [Assessing the Chemical Intelligence of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07735) and [A Framework for Evaluating Chemical Knowledge and Reasoning of LLMs against Chemists](https://www-nature-com.proxy.bnl.lu/articles/s41557-025-01815-x)

These papers are coming out hot off the heels from OpenAI's recent-ish [announcement](https://x.com/gdb/status/1925944910634463729) on 23 May 2025 that ChatGPT can now work with the RDKit. Having played around with ChatGPT and RDKit back in 2022, I inevitably had the same question as Markus Sitzmann:

Now with these 'improvements' to ChatGPT's knowledge of chemistry and ability to use RDKit, I wanted to see if it could solve an environmental problem I worked on during my PhD.

(In fact, I'm hoping AI can do better than I ever could.)

PlasticChem
COCONUT

### Go AI Go
todo: try perplexity, claude, gemini

### Humans 1, AI 0?
I worked on this problem on-and-off for 3 years. It's not a perfect solution by any means especially in terms of [software development](/_posts/2023-09-03-reflections-software.md/tests).
